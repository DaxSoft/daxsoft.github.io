<h1>Features</h1>

<div class='todo'>
    <label>Light System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            For this project I have adapted the 'pixi-lights' to let you create a gorgeous ambience for your game.
            So, you will be able to create lights using this system as well, you can create 'normal lights', in
            which is using normal pictures (sprites) with blend modes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Collision & Movement System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            For this project I have adapted the 'sinova-collision' system to create the Collision system. 
            As well, I've build a pixel-movement that follows up the grid of 8x8. However, sprites & objects 
            can move freely, the grid it will only be used as reference. 

            For the animation movement and collision bodies for sprites, all setup datas will be stored in .json files,
            and it will have a editor to edit it.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Time System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            Native Time System cycle that will allow you to create specific moments and ambience. You can, for instance, create 
            lights and behaviors of NPCs that it's triggered only when the period of the day is night.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Particle System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            For this project I've adapted the 'pixi-particles', so you can use the online editor available 
            and put him on your game. There will be a editor to configure your setup as well.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Weather System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox">

        <p>
            I will create a unique weather system that suits 2d games from scratch. The concept is using 
            points & terrain as emmitter. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>3D Spatial Sound System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            For this project I've adapted the 'goldfire-howler' to allow you create a unique sound ambience for your game.
            In which, you can create sounds using position to influence the volume and so on.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Map System</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            In this project there will be no use on the default editor of the RPG Maker MV to create the maps (only for events/npc). 
            With this plugin, you can create the map on Photoshop (I would recommend this one), or Gimp or whatever other program, 
            since you follow up the rules of the system...

            On the map you can have three floors (under, base, high). In each floor, you can have 5 layers 
            (background, ground, npc/objects, above npc/objects, above everything). And for each floor, you can setup different 
            light, filter, particle, sound, weather sources. In a nutshell, is three maps in one.
        </p>
    </div>

    <label>Map Editor in-game</label>
    <div>
        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            There is a map editor in which you can edit maps in-game, to at the same that you edit the map itself,
            you can test & see the performace that you will achieve. 
            It includes:
             - Light Editor 
             - Particle Editor 
             - Weather Editor 
             - Collision Editor 
             - Sprite Editor 
             - Filter Editor
             - Sound Editor
        </p>
