<h1>Description</h1>

<p>For this project I have adapted the 'sinova-collision' system to create the Collision system.
    As well, I've build a pixel-movement that follows up the grid of 8x8. However, sprites & objects
    can move freely, the grid it will only be used as reference.

            * horizontal - it's for passages in which the direction is up/down
            * vertical - it's for passages in which the direction is left/right
