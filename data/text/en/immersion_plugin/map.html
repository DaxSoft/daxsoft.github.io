<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
    You will can create great maps without the limitation of the standard map editor of the engine.
    So, for each map, you can set up three floors (under, base and high). 
    And, for each floor, you can set up five layers (background, ground, npc/objects, above npc/objects, above all).
    As well, for each floor, you can set up different particles, lights, sounds, weather and filters.

        <p>
            For each map, you can set up three floors. Of course, if you want to, you can only set one.
            In which is, by default, 'base'.

            For each floor:
                - Light Sources 
                - Particle Sources 
                - Filter Effects
                - Collision Bodies
                - Weather Sources 
                - Sound Sources 
        </p>

        <input type="checkbox" checked>

        <p>
            I've adapted the 'davidfig-pixi-viewport', to create a nice effect on the camera. 
            So the camera will follow in a smooth way, to show up the map. 

            - You can set up the camera to target the player or whatever npc
            - You can set up the speed of the camera movement
            - You can set up zoom effect
